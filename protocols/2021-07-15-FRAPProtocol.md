### Total Antioxidant Potential (FRAP) Protocol 

This protocol is adapted from [Griffin and Bhagooli 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002209810300515X?casa_token=AfLDqurMV9MAAAAA:5JBuNauuMbQJfZTkLZ1HtAsWqqoEBSTz4sp9jG4jPf1bkw_jq65WZ_2NbFe_JlgK44rVrPF2mg).

#### Protocol Steps 

##### 1) Shuck oyster, dissect out part of gill tissue and put tissue in pre-labeled, pre-weighed 1 mL microcentrifuge tube.

Store at -80C. 

##### 2) Add 75 uL of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer to freshly thawed samples of oyster gill tissue and homogenize using a sonicator. 

##### 3) Centrifuge samples for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. 

##### 4) Transfer supernatant to new 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube.

##### 5) Remove 15-20 uL aliquot for protein BCA assay for total protein and re-freeze at -80°C.

##### 6) Add xx uL of protease inhibitor cocktail to the remaining supernatant. 

##### 7) Prepare standard curve using known Fe II concentrations (FeSO4·7H2O)

For 20 uL sample volume (in 96-well plate): 

| Standard conc.  | Volume | Vol. MilliQ | Total vol.
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
1. 1000 uM |	27.801 mg FeSO4·7H2O | 100 mL	| 99.89 mL
2. 2500 uM | 50 uL from tube 1 | 50 uL | 100 uL
3. 200 uM | 60 uL from tube 1	| 240 uL | 105 uL
4. 150 uM	 | 105 uL from tube 3 | 35 uL | 90 uL
5. 100 uM	| 90 uL from tube 3 | 90 uL | 110 uL
6. 75 uM | 50 uL from tube 4 | 50 uL | 100 uL
7. 50 uM	| 70 uL from tube 5| 70 uL | 90 uL
8. 25 uM | 50 uL from tube 7 | 50 uL | 100 uL
9.  0 uM | NA	 | 100 uL | 100 uL

##### 8) Prepare working reagent.  

To run samples in a 96 well plate, 15 mL of working reagent is needed. 

- Combine 12.5 mL 300 mM acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 1.25 mL 10 mM TPTZ solution, and 1.25 mL 20 mM FeCl3·6H2O in a 50 mL falcon tube. 

##### 9) Warm working reagent to 37C 

Did I do this step?

##### 10) Run a blank 96 well plate with working reagent. 
- Using a multi-channel pipette, add 150 uL of warm working reagent to each well. 
- Put 96 well plate in plate reader at 37C and measure blank absorbance at 600nm. 

##### 11) Measure FRAP using 96 well plate and plate reader. 

- After the blank measurement, remove the plate from the plate reader and add 20uL of sample/standard to each well. Pipette up and down to mix working reagent solution and samples/standard. 
- Incubate plate in plate reader at 37C for 4-8 minutes. 
- Measure absorbance again at 600nm.

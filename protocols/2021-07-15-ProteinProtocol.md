### Protein Content Protocol

This protocol is from the ThermoScientific Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit. User guide is [here](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011430_Pierce_BCA_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogUGllcmNlIEJDQSBQcm90ZWluIEFzc2F5IEtpdA==). 

#### Materials and Equipment 
- 15 mL falcon tubes
- [Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23225#/23225)
- Plate reader
- Ethanol
- 96 well flat-bottom plate

#### Protocol Steps 

##### 1) Prepare standards 

Use the table below (from the BSA user guide) to make standards.

##### 2) Prepare working reagent.  

- Use the following formula to determine total volume of working reagent needed: 

*Total WR volume required = (# standards + # samples) x (# replicates) x (volume of WR per standard/sample)*

- Make working reagent by mixing 50 parts BCA Reagent A with 1 part BCA Reagent B (50:1, Reagent A:B).

##### 7) Measure protein content using 96 well plate and plate reader.

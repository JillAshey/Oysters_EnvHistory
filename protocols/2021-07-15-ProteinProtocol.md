### Protein Content Protocol

This protocol is from the ThermoScientific Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit. User guide is [here](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011430_Pierce_BCA_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogUGllcmNlIEJDQSBQcm90ZWluIEFzc2F5IEtpdA==).

#### Protocol Steps 

##### 1) Prepare samples - come from gill tissue




-  Weigh out 10-20mg of dried, homogenized tissue and put it in a pre-labeled, pre-weighed 15 mL falcon tube. To obtain dried tissue, follow steps 1-3 in [Glycogen Protocol](https://github.com/JillAshey/Oysters_EnvHistory/blob/main/protocols/2021-07-15-GlycogenProtocol.md).
-  Add xx mL of ultrapure water to the falcon tube (if this is too concentrated during measurements, dilute further). 
-  Using a sonicator, further homogenize the tissue until it becomes a tissue slurry. 

##### 2) Prepare standards 

Use the table below (from the BSA user guide) to make standards.

| Vial  | Vol. MilliQ (uL) | Vol. BSA (uL) | Final BSA conc. (ug/mL)
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
A |	0 | 300 stock | 2000
B |	125 | 375 stock | 1500
C |	325 | 325 stock | 1000
D |	175 | 175 vial B | 750
E |	325 | 325 vial C | 500
F |	325 | 325 vial E | 250
G |	325 | 325 vial F | 125
H |	400 | 100 vial G | 25
I |	400 | 0 | 0




##### 3) Prepare working reagent.  

- Use the following formula to determine total volume of working reagent needed: 

*Total WR volume required = (# standards + # samples) x (# replicates) x (volume of WR per standard/sample)*

- Make working reagent by mixing 50 parts BCA Reagent A with 1 part BCA Reagent B (50:1, Reagent A:B).

##### 4) Measure protein content using 96 well plate and plate reader. 

- Using a 96-well plate, add 25µL of sample or standard to each well. 
- Using a multi-channel pipette, add 200µL of working reagent to each well. Pipette up and down to mix working reagent solution and samples/standard. 
- Once all wells are filled, shake plate laterally on plate reader for 30 seconds. 
- Cover plate and incubate at 37C for 30 minutes. 
- Cool plate to room temperature 
- Measure absorbance at 562nm.

### Glycogen Protocol


This protocol is adapted from [Guevelou and Allen 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848616301338). 


#### Materials and Equipment 
- 15 mL falcon tubes
- Freeze dryer
- Centrifuge
- Plate reader
- Mortar and pestel 
- 15% trichloroacetic acid: Sigma T6399-100g
- Potassium iodine (KI): Sigma 746428-100G
- Iodine (I): Sigma 207772-100G
- Calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2) 
- Pure glycogen from oyster: Sigma G8751-5g
- Ethanol
- 96 well flat-bottom plate

#### Protocol Steps 

##### 1) Shuck oyster and put tissue in pre-labeled, pre-weighed 15 mL falcon tube. 

##### 2) Freeze dry tissue. 

Remove cap from falcon tube, cover top of tube with aluminum foil, and poke small holes in the foil. 

[more info on freeze drying to be added here]

##### 3) Weigh the now-dried tissue in the falcon tube. Then, homogenize dried tissue with mortar and pestel. 

##### 4) Weigh out 20-40mg of dried, homogenized tissue and put it in a new pre-labeled, pre-weighed 15 mL falcon tube. 

##### 5) Extract glycogen. 

- Add 3 mL of 15% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to falcon tube.
- Vortex for 10 seconds, then store at 4C for 1 hour.
- Centrifuge at 3000g for 10 minutes. 
- Move 500 µL of supernatant to new 15 mL falcon tubes. 
- Add 4 mL of ethanol and vortex for 10 seconds. 
- Store overnight at 4C. 
- The next day, centrifuge at 34000g for 60 minutes. 
- Remove and discard all supernatant in falcon tubes, leaving pellet. 
- Dissolve pellet in 500 to 2000µL of distilled water (if this is too concentrated during measurements, dilute further). 

##### 6) Make reagents and standards for measurement. 

*Note: for this step onwards, do all steps with lights off. Iodine is light-sensitive.*

- Make KI2 solution: 0.26g iodine + 2.6g KI + 10 mL ultrapure water.
- Make CaCl2 saturated: ~500g in 500 mL ultrapure water.
- Make KI2CaCl2: 500 mL CaCl2 + 1.92 mL KI2
- Use pure glycogen from oyster to make standards (0 to 1mg/mL of pure glycogen)

##### 7) Measure glycogen using 96 well plate and plate reader. 

- Using a 96-well plate, add 20µL of sample or standard to each well. 
- Using a multi-channel pipette, add 130µL of KI2CaCl2 to each well. Pipette up and down to mix reagent solution and samples/standard. 
- Once all wells are filled, cover plate and incubate in a drawer at room temperature for 30 minutes. 
- Place plate on plate reader and measure glycogen concentrations with settings of 450nm with 60 seconds of lateral shaking.

#### Materials and Equipment 
- Mesh bags 
- Zip ties
- Milk crates 
- Rope
- YSI ProPlus
- Acid-washed borosilicate glass bottles
- Saturated mercuric chloride
- Pipette and tips 
- Plastic 1L Nalgene bottles 
- Small glass vials

#### Protocol Steps 

##### 1) Obtain oysters for deployment at selected sites. 

For this project, the selected sites were Merroir, Piankatank River, Urbanna Creek, and VIMS Pier. The oysters were obtained from the Aquaculture Genetics and Breeding Technology Center at VIMS (diploid, broodstock family LOLA18).

##### 2) Measure shell length of all oysters using calipers. 

To measure shell length, measure the length from the hinge to the farthest point of the bill. 

##### 3) Place oysters in mesh bags, zip-tie bag shut, and suspend bag in milk crate with zip-ties. 

The oysters should have enough room to feed in the mesh bags. 

##### 4) Tie one end of the rope to an above ground anchor (i.e. dock, pier, etc) and the other end to the milk crate. Once the knots are secure, lower milk crate into the water.

##### 5) Collect water for YSI measurements (temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen). 

- Fill a plastic Nalgene bottle with seawater from the site. Rinse 3x before filling.
- Remove the YSI probes from their storage solution and put on the cage to protect the probes. 
- Put probes in the Nalgene bottle and swirl them to get continuous water flow. 
- Record measurements when values stabilize on YSI. 
- Remove probes from cage and put back in storage solution. Water in Nalgene can be discarded. 

##### 6) Collect water for pH spectrometry. 

*These next steps only pertain to the VIMS Pier site. Because we have immediate access to a spectrophotometer, the pH of the water can be measured without having to poison it with mercuric chlroide.*

- Refill a plastic Nalgene bottle with new seawater 
- Fill 3 small glass vials with water. Rinse 3x before filling. Fill the vials until they are completely full and cap them. Make sure there are no air bubbles!!
- Within one hour of collection, measure the pH of the samples using the spectrophotmoeter. More on using the spectrophotometer here. 

##### 7) Collect water for total alkalinity measurements. 

*VIMS only*

- At VIMS, fill a pre-labeled Nalgene bottle ~3/4 with seawater. Rinse 3x before filling.
- Store bottle at -20C within an hour of collection for later total alkalinity analysis. 

*Remote sites*

- Fill acid-washed borosilicate glass bottles with seawater. Rinse 3x before filling. Do not fill the entire bottle, leave a little space at the top. 
- Add xx mL of mercuric chloride to the bottle. This will stop all biological activity and preserve the water chemistry. 
- Coat the part of stopper that goes into bottle with oil (??). Put stopper in the bottle and parafilm the top. 

#### Monitoring after initial deployment

During each subsequent visit to a site, do protocol steps 2-3 and 5-7.  

Count oysters during each visit and remove any dead ones.

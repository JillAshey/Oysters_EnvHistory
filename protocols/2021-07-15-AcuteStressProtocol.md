#### Materials and Equipment 

- [32 oz. plastic container](https://www.amazon.com/Sets-Plastic-Storage-Containers-Airtight/dp/B01HBV4WO0/ref=pd_bxgy_img_1/145-6564934-3763553?pd_rd_w=Ls9G7&pf_rd_p=c64372fa-c41c-422e-990d-9e034f73989b&pf_rd_r=6YXBREG0KD6WFMRNE0C0&pd_rd_r=90216584-d55a-4bfe-a5fc-bb0d4385f41a&pd_rd_wg=uSPbE&pd_rd_i=B01HBV4WO0&psc=1)
- [Airline tubing](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/imagitarium-clear-airline-tubing)
- [Air stones](https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/imagitarium-bubbling-column-airstone-4-pack)
- [Egg crate](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Plaskolite-4-ft-x-2-ft-Suspended-Egg-Crate-Light-Ceiling-Panel-1199233A/202025149)
- Blocks
- Distilled water 

#### Protocol Steps 

##### 1) Prepare set-up for exposure 

- Cut squares in egg crate so that the plastic containers can be held in there. 
- Put egg crate on blocks in tank with flow-through water. It should be positioned so that the bottom 3/4 of the plastic containers in the egg crate should be submerged in the water. This was to hold oysters at uniform, environmentally relevant temperatures throughout the exposure
- Drill holes in the lids of plastic containers so that tubing can be inserted to bubble in air to sustain and standardize suitable oxygenation and carbonate chemistry. 
- Connect airline tubing to air inputs and cut the tubing so that there is one airline tube for each plastic container. 
- Put an airstone at the end of the airline tubes

##### 2) Make treatment water

- Determine the salinities to be used in the exposure. 
	- Ambient salinity was defined as the average salinity experienced by oysters at their most recent in situ location and was determined by averaging the salinity measurements collected over the prior deployment period 
	- Low salinity was determined to be 5 psu
- To generate low and ambient salinity treatments, mix distilled water was mixed with coarsely filtered water from the York River to achieve the desired salinity. If the desired salinity is higher than the incoming water from the York River, use Instant Ocean to reach desired salinity.
- Make treatment water 12 hours before its needed. Bubble atmospheric air using an airstone in treatment water for 12 hours. 

##### 3) Add oysters to containers and begin exposures.

- Put 800 mL of treatment water in plastic containers
- Put oysters in containers and secure containers in egg crate. 
- Once container is secure in egg crate (which is in the tank with flow-through water), put the lid on the container and put an airline tube through the hole in the top of the lid 
- Use a YSI to measure temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen in each container. 
- Collect water from each treatment for total alkalinity and spectrophometric pH. 

##### 4) Replace water in containers every 12 hours.

- To minimize build-up of nitrogenous waste, water in the containers was replaced every 12 hours with freshly prepared treatment water. 
- Take YSI measurements in each container before replacing water. 
- Collect water from each treatment for total alkalinity and spectrophometric pH. 

##### 5) After exposure (48 hours), dissect and preserve gill tissue from each oyster.

- Gill tissue was preserved in pre-labeled, pre-weighed falson tubes at -80C for later analysis of total antioxidant potential and total protein content
- Protocol for total antioxidant potential is [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/Oysters_EnvHistory/blob/main/protocols/2021-07-15-FRAPProtocol.md); protocol for total protein is [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/Oysters_EnvHistory/blob/main/protocols/2021-07-15-ProteinProtocol.md).
